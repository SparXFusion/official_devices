* Fixed fingerprint.
* Used other device tree, kernel, and vendor files (thanks: https://github.com/mahajant99).
* Change kernel (Loki kernel -> Kerminator).
* I am very sorry for the inconvenience with the finger scanner.
* NOTE: If you get any bugs after update, please do wipe data/factory reset.
